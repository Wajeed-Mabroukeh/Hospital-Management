Specialized hospitals include trauma centers,  &#10;rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals,seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific &#10;medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. &#10;Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.Hospitals are classified as&#10; general, &#10;specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.&#10;">
